Implement a data structure that stores integers. We can add elements to the data structure.

The class has a pop_med() method, which returns and removes the element that is closest to the median. (In case of ambiguity, return the smaller closest element.)

Median:
odd element number: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11  → 5
(pop_med() should return 5)
even element number: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 12  → (5+7)/2 = 6
(pop_med() should return 5)
